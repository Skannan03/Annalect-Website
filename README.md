Hello There Viewers !!!!!
I Started this project just for fun to test the features present inthe company that im working. I learned a lot of new things that are present in the website ,
I have tested most of the important features present in the website and 

Some of the things that i learned are ....
:- How to code based on Design pattern and Repo pattern 
:- Code optimization ( I wrote a lot of code that repeated multiple times - Then i realized that all the code can be optimized and made short )
:- Code Alignment, The code should be structured ( I created packages for each webpage and wrote code accordingly and organized all the code )

Problems that i faced .... 
:- Code optimization - there was a lot of code that kept repeating ( so i started learning more about code optimization and 
   started refactoring the code and made it as short aas possible )
:- Functions - Created user defined functions to reduce the code as much as possible and added them in the base class.
:- Handling multiple tabs was an issue while testing - it did not switch to the tab that i was expecting then ,
  ( Then i came to know index number was an problem i have to close the previous tabs or the tabs the are opened )
